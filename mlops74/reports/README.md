# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is auto
generated in the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image to
the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

will generate an `.html` page of your report. After deadline for answering this template, we will autoscrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate an `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final handin.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

will check your answers in this template against the constrains listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, have you included an image when asked to.

For both functions to work it is important that you do not rename anything. The script have two dependencies that can
be installed with `pip install click markdown`.

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustic* which means that it includes everything that you could possible do on the project in
relation the curricilum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked of all boxes at the
end of the project.

### Question 3
> **What framework did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

To manage our DTU class project, we adopted a structured approach using Cookiecutter with the MLOps template. Our primary version control tool was Git, which facilitated the tracking of changes made by individual group members. In terms of data management, we leveraged DVC to store image data and PyTorch objects to save modified data. We explored the use of Google Drive and GCP buckets for data storage.

For the development environment, Docker played a crucial role in creating and managing containerized images for training our model on a virtual machine. Additionally, we employed Hydra to handle configuration loading. In our quest for continuous integration, we experimented with GitHub Actions; however, we encountered challenges related to dependencies and the continuous building of Docker images.

Furthermore, we established a GCP bucket for our project, and for accessing our application, we implemented FastAPI.


## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

First thing first a new member would have to clone the github repository, using anaconda framework he can create a virtual environment "conda create --name myenv python=<version_needed>", the python version is declared in the Makefile file.
The next step is running "pip install requirements.txt" that will install all the necessary packages, this file can be created running th ecommand "pipreqs ." in the root directory of the project. (DO WE NEED MORE THUINGSSSSS?????)

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. Did you fill out every folder or only a subset?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
> Answer:

From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the data/raw folder with the images, after processing them we saved them in the data/processed directory. Under models we saved the checkpoints with the model's hyperparameters (weights, biases and model architecture), this specifications were created using torch. 
The test files we created have been placed under /tests. 
We then have the /smoke folder which is the main project, it contains the configuration files and the python scripts to create the dataset (/data/make_dataset.py) and to create and train the model (/models/model.py and /models/train_model.py) 
We didn't use the entire structure of the cookiecutter template such the visualization folder in /smoke or the notebooks one in the base cookiecutter template. 

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? Additionally, explain with your own words why these**
> **concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Answer:

While we didn't implement any specific rules, we aimed to follow the PEP 8 guidelines for code quality and formatting. These guidelines matter in larger projects because they help with consistency and readability across the codebase. This, in turn, enhances collaboration, makes code maintenance more manageable, and reduces the chances of introducing errors. In larger teams, adhering to such standards becomes crucial to ensure everyone can understand, contribute and maintain the code effectively.

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

In total we have implemented 3 different tests: test_data.py, test_model.py and test_training.py, placed under /test directory. 

1) test_data.py tests wheter the make_dataset.py script creates or not the proper dataset for DataLoader(), if it is consistent with the training validation and test set. The specific tests include shape of images, labels, lenghts and so on. 
2) test_model.py contains two different tests, one is testing if the model provides with the expected output format and the other checks the input format that we feed in the model.
3) test_training.py assure us to create the necessary folders and saves the proper files containg the model's checkpoints after succesfully training the model (if some errors occur an assertion error will be raised). 


### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If you code had an code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

We obtained a code coverage of 100%, which includes all our source code. However, even with full code coverage, we wouldn't necessarily trust the code to be entirely error-free. Code coverage measures how many lines of code are executed during testing but does not guarantee the correctness of the code's logic or the absence of subtle bugs.
There are still many errors that can occur and that our tests scripts do not detect, which is why no one sshould completely trust a script even getting a total coverage.

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

Since we worked on github, we created different branches to not encounter conflicts during the development of the project, we often had to use pull/push command in order to keep the local repositories updated with the newly added file and modifications. 
While working on the project we created different branches based on the necessity, when we wanted to test/implement a new idea we tried first on a new branch and kept the integrity of other branches intact, only after successfully completed the new codes we merged everything together in the main branch.
With pull requests we were able to go detail by detail before merging different branches and only keep the necessary and most evolved parts of the project.  


### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

We did use DVC since the processed image files were to big to be stored in the github repository as they were saved as a pytorch file, we had to set up a remote folder for storing the necessary data files and also, later on, to store the model's checkpoints. 
It was easy to access the files from the dvc storage unit although in the workflow process we were not able to access the files since the ultimated process didn't provide with proper http: link for autenticating the google drive repository where our data files were stored. 
Version control is an extremely useful tool, it allows developers to keep track of changes made on a dataset and give the possibility to multiple people to work on it simultanuosly.

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continues integration setup. What kind of CI are you running (unittesting, linting, etc.)? Do you test**

### Question 16

> **When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you**
> **try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling*
> *run of our main code at some point that showed ...*
>
> Answer:

We performed debugging mostly troubleshooting the errors we were getting on our way, AI tools like chatGPT have been extremely helpful for understanding how to troubleshoot some of the errors. We also performed some profiling on our scripts but we did not modified it much since they were working, we focused on developing the other parts of the project.

## Working in the cloud

>
> Answer:

At first working with GCP was challeenging and managing to actually update the data was not immidiate, after some efforts we managed to connect everything and use the following tools: 
1) Google Cloud Compute Engine that provides virtual machines (VMs) for our project in order to set up our development and deployment environments, allowing us to run and manage code and applications in a scalable and controlled manner.
2) Google Cloud Storage (Bucket): would have served as our data storage solution. We would have stored various project assets, including datasets and model checkpoints, in these buckets.

>
> Answer:

One of the trickiest parts of our project was getting the hang of all the different tools and technologies, especially since many of them were new to our team. We had to find a balance between learning these tools and keeping our project organized. Luckily, we found Cookiecutter to be a real lifesaver. It helped us structure our project and provided answers to many of our questions, keeping our workspace clean and tidy.

However, we can't ignore the fact that we faced some major challenges during the project:
Working with APIs and GCP turned out to be very hard. We often ran into problems, some of which are still unresolved. The complexity of GCP services and of API integration forced us to dive deep into troubleshooting, which often meant spending a lot of time trying to figure things out.
Another challenge was setting up a solid CI pipeline. We wanted our project to follow best practices, but we kept running into errors during testing. For some of us, it was the first time dealing with these CI issues, making it even more confusing. We had to learn how to debug these problems, understand why they were happening, and work together to find effective solutions.

### Question 27

> **State the individual contributions of each team member. This is required information from DTU, because we need to**
> **make sure all members contributed actively to the project**
>
> Answer length: 50-200 words.

> Example:
> *Student sXXXXXX was in charge of developing of setting up the initial cookie cutter project and developing of the*
> *docker containers for training our applications.*
> *Student sXXXXXX was in charge of training our models in the cloud and deploying them afterwards.*
> *All members contributed to code by...*
>
> Answer:

s223588 was in charge of developing the cookiecutter structure and to implement the make_dataset.py and model.py scripts (that have been improved and modify by the other team members as well), he was also in charge of setting some CI on the github repository and to create a gcp bucket for the data.
